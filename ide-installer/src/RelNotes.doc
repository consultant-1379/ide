    New Features

[ Rel. 1.0.1.4 ]     2/03/2016
    Bug Fixing
	- AXIX team Issue: (8/03) The windows installer created a 
          shortcut on the desktop with the wrong link (i.e.:
          "C:\Users\ekemark\..\ENM_IDE_Base\ENM_IDE_Base.vbox")
          FIX:
	    Run the VM double clicking on the desktop icon
	    Run the IDE in desktop mode if you select that option 
            during installation steps

[ Rel. 1.0.1.5 ]     2/03/2016
    Bug Fixing
	- AXIX team Issue: (8/03) Does it always download the latest
                                  vagrant file.
	  Reason of Issue:
             The latest Vagrantfile is copied from Gerrit only it the
             automatic "vagrant up" is choiced ("Yes")
          FIX:
            The fix is on "PerformVagrantUp" routine to move out of the 
             the "if answer Yes" the curl:
             Exec('cmd.exe','/C powershell -command "$clnt = new-object System.net.WebClient; $clnt.DownloadFile(\"https://gerrit.ericsson.se/gitweb?p=OSS/com.ericsson.de/ide.git; a=blob_plain;f=vagrant/Vagrantfile\",\"'+ strIdeTargetPath + '\Vagrantfile\")"','', SW_HIDE, ewWaitUntilTerminated, ResultCode);

	- AXIX team Issue: (8/03) The windows installer gave an error
                                  "Reading the file size failed"

[ Rel. 1.0.1.6 ]     14/03/2016
    Bug Fixing
	- CIS-24421 (14/03): IDE Installer Exe throws "Reading the file
                             size failed." error.
	  Reason of Issue:
            The C:\Temp directory not already present on target PC
          FIX:
            The fix is to avoid to create the C:\Temp directory if not
            already present. 
	    That directory needs only to redirect the 
                      "vagrant up --debug" output.
	    So the solution is redirect this OutVagrantUp.log output log
            file into the target ENM_IDE\log directory
                     

	- CIS-24444 (14/03):  IDE Installer doesn't run vagrant up.
	  Reason of Issue:
            The C:\Temp directory not already present on target PC
          FIX:
	    The fix is to avoid to create the C:\Temp directory if not 
            already present.

            file into the target ENM_IDE\log directory

[ Rel. 1.0.1.14 ]     1/06/2016
    New features:
	- Removed the starting information box that shows commands to be used 
          on IDE for upgrades

 
    Bug Fixing:
	- CIS-26686:  ENM IDE: Installation fails when another older VM-Vbox is
		      already installed
	  Reason of Issue:
  	     ENM_IDE installer for Windows was not forcing the installation of
             its associated VirtualBox Extention pack after the VirtualBox
             installation on the patrget PC.
             This cause a misalignment on VirtualBox that more often can make 
	     failures on Vagrant VM.
	  FIX:
	     Added new method "RunVBoxPackInstaller" and run it after VBox has 
	     been installed.

	- CIS-26204:  ENM IDE support to install IDE.
	  Reason of Issue:
		 more often user cannot uninstall already installed VirtualBox 
		 because one have already a different development environment 
                 or VMs configured, and ide-installer new VBox installation
		 could risk to destroy that VMs or make them unusable.
	  FIX:
		Added the check of current installed release using "wmic"
		 

[ Rel. 1.0.1.15 ]     23/06/2016
    New features:
	- New structure of artifact: now it is a zip that contains the .exe, the .cer, and a .bat dos batch file that is the installer to be run by target user (it allows to add the certificate into the Trusted Root Path on target PC)

 
    Bug Fixing:
	- CIS-27333:  ENM IDE: publisher unknown due to absence of signature

	  Reason of Issue:
  	     ENM_IDE installer for Windows had not signature. 

	  FIX:
	     A signature introduced and also a certificate created an 
          packed into the new .zip format.
